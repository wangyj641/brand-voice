There is a coffee farming community behind every cup of Tims coffee that we serve. Together with our local partners, we aim to continuously strengthen the businesses and futures of coffee farmers.
Tims Coffee for Communities program
Helping empower coffee farmers to improve their livelihoods through training in partnership with local coffee exporters, not-for-profits and producer organizations.
Enveritas
We are proud to partner with Enveritas, which assesses 100% of Tim Hortons coffee purchases each year under a set of social, economic and environmental indicators.
Through our coffee for communities program, we use Enveritasâ€™ unique model, an innovative and accurate way to measure farm level sustainability for all of the coffee that we purchase. Together we engage every supplier and use the accuracy of the data to identify challenges facing farmers within our supply chain. This allows us to design programs that focus efforts on our commitment to enhancing farmer livelihoods in all of our coffee farming communities, while contributing to farm level sustainability and quality of coffee production.
